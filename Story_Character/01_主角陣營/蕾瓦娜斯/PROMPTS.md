## Codex Generation Manifest

### (a) Exact filenames
- [ ] 01-levanus-young-front-fullbody.png — PENDING-USER-APPROVAL (SCENE 02 young version)
- [x] 01-levanus-adult-front-fullbody.png — PRESENT (adult version; retained as a separate age variant)
- [ ] 02-levanus-four-view-master.png — PENDING-GENERATION
- [ ] 03-levanus-expression-sheet.png — PENDING-GENERATION
- [ ] 04-levanus-costume-detail-sheet.png — PENDING-GENERATION
- [ ] 05-levanus-color-material-sheet.png — PENDING-GENERATION
- [ ] 06-levanus-prop-construction-sheet.png — PENDING-GENERATION
- [ ] 07-levanus-body-reference-sheet.png — PENDING-GENERATION

### (b) Character gate

Generate only 01-levanus-young-front-fullbody.png first. Present that single image and stop. Generate the remaining sheets only after explicit user approval of the young 01. Other characters do not change this character's gate.

### (c) Consistency statement

The filenames above exactly match the section filenames below. Identity, body metrics, costume and fixed palette come from the same Canonical Fact Map as CHARACTER_SPEC.md.

### (d) Fixed input images

For 01, use all three style images below only as visual-style references and never copy their depicted person's identity:
- ../../style/SV8zdQHTYqQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg.png
- ../../style/McEZ7GwGWkAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg.png
- ../../style/8fJgh1kde6P3IAAAAASUVORK5CYII.png

For 02–07, additionally use ./01-levanus-young-front-fullbody.png as this character's identity reference while retaining all three fixed style images.

### (e) Existing PNG state

All files are PENDING-GENERATION. Do not overwrite any future approved PNG.

### (f) Single-generation policy

Each user image request permits at most one image-generation call and one new image. Present it immediately and stop. Technical inspection may report possible deviations but must not auto-reject, move or regenerate. Age variants are retained as explicitly named sibling files, not treated as rejects.

## Instruction for Codex

Read <repo-root>/Story_Character/01_主角陣營/蕾瓦娜斯/CHARACTER_SPEC.md and this PROMPTS.md. Follow the generation gate. Generate exactly one image per user request, begin with 01-levanus-young-front-fullbody.png, present it and stop for approval.
